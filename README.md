# Advent of Code 2022 using WhiteBox & C

These are the source files I created when solving the 2022 Advent of Code challenges.
It was my first year taking part, and I streamed myself working through them using [WhiteBox](https://whitebox.systems) to give me immediate feedback on the code I'd written so far.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly event in which Christmas-themed programming challenges are released for every day of advent.
They can be solved in any language, but I chose to use C.

I completed both parts of every day up to day 15 (and started the first part of 16)...
At this point I promptly got the flu until well after Christmas, and by then real work needed more attention.

There's a [collection of videos of the entire coding & problem-solving process on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/collections/IPb0J8BPLhcS9g).
